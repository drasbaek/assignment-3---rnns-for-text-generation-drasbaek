# Assignment 3 - Language modelling and text generation using RNNs

Text generation is hot news right now!

For this assignemnt, you're going to create some scripts which will allow you to train a text generation model on some culturally significant data - comments on articles for *The New York Times*. You can find a link to the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aashita/nyt-comments).

You should create a collection of scripts which do the following:

- Train a model on the Comments section of the data
  - [Save the trained model](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/models/save_model)
- Load a saved model
  - Generate text from a user-suggested prompt

## Objectives

Language modelling is hard and training text generation models is doubly hard. For this course, we lack somewhat the computationl resources, time, and data to train top-quality models for this task. So, if your RNNs don't perform overwhelmingly, that's fine (and expected). Think of it more as a proof of concept.

- Using TensorFlow to build complex deep learning models for NLP
- Illustrating that you can structure repositories appropriately
- Providing clear, easy-to-use documentation for your work.

## Some tips

One big thing to be aware of - unlike the classroom notebook, this assignment is working on the *Comments*, not the articles. So two things to consider:

1) The Comments data might be structured differently to the Articles data. You'll need to investigate that;
2) There are considerably more Comments than articles - plan ahead for model training!

## Additional pointers

- Make sure not to try to push the data to Github!
- *Do* include the saved models that you output
- Make sure to structure your repository appropriately
  - Include a readme explaining relevant info
    - E.g where does the data come from?
    - How do I run the code?
- Make sure to include a requirements file, etc...
